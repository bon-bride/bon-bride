quote: "“I want to offer alternative options and for each collection to evolve with
  a new generation of modern women. It is not “timeless” and it doesn’t claim to create
  “classic” pieces. It’s of the moment and it celebrates the women of this moment
  in time, the bride of now.”"
author: Pippa Cooke
paragraph-2: Whether from the collection or the bespoke service, BON BRIDÉ defines
  itself by making each dress unique. The personalised service offers an exclusive
  experience that has been the founder’s aspiration since she got married herself
  in 2013.
quote-2: "“No one dress can suite everyone and nor should it, I want to offer flexibility
  for every bride to put their own stamp on their look ”"

Founder and creative director of BON BRIDÉ is ex fashion buyer and product developer, Pippa Cooke. Having spent over ten years immersed in the industry, buying for retail giant Topshop, cult label House of Hackney and Luxury department store Harrods, Pippa felt the time was right to adopt her fashion forward aesthetic and disrupt the bridal industry.

With BON BRIDÉ, Pippa creates understated yet striking dresses about women and for women who dress for themselves. With feminist principles at its core, BON BRIDÉ does things differently, breaking from the norms of the modern wedding.
